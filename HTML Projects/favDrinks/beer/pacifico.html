		<h2 id="born"><i>... MAZATLAN</i></h2>
		<p>In 1900, three German brewers established Cervecería 
		del Pacifico in the small Mexican port town of Mazatlán. 
		Word of the exceptionally drinkable pilsner-style lager 
		traveled fast. Soon, thirst for Pacifico spread from Sinaloa 
		and up the rugged Baja coastline.</p>
		
		<h2 id="found"><i>... BAJA</i></h2>
		<p>Fast forward to the early 1970s. A group of California 
		surfers ventured south in their van to explore the breaks 
		along the coast. Eventually they found themselves in Baja, 
		where they also discovered hidden surf spots, friendly cantinas, 
		and a beloved local beer called Pacifico.<p>
		
		<h2 id="import"><i>... SURFERS</i></h2>
		<p>Excited by their find, the story goes, the wandering surfers 
		loaded up a few cases of the rich golden lager into their van 
		and returned north, becoming the first importers of Pacifico. 
		Back in Southern California, the Baja-born cerveza gained a 
		passionate following among surfers who journeyed south for the 
		breaks, and returned with a beer well worth the trip.</p>
		
		<h2 id="today"><i>SO MUCH MORE</i> to <b>DISCOVER</b></h2>
		<p>Today, our journey from tiny cantinas in Baja, to SoCal 
		in the back of surf vans, to places off the beaten path has 
		made Pacifico a symbol of discovery and the perfect way to 
		celebrate it. Now, it’s your turn. Go explore, because where 
		the map ends is where adventure begins.</p>
