		<h3 id="descript">Description Of Guinness Draught</h3>
		<p>Rich and creamy. Distinctively black. Velvety in its finish. 
		   This iconic beer is defined by harmony. Sip after sip, sweet 
		   counters bitter as the malt arrives on cue to compliment a 
		   base of roasted barley. Just as the unmistakable white head 
		   sits flush atop the dark beer, so do the flavors counter and 
		   combine perfectly. This is our greatest innovation. Truly 
		   unique. Perfectly balanced. Made of More™.</p>
		
		<h3 id="Story">The Story Of Guinness Draught</h3>
		<p>Developed in 1959, this beer was our brewers’ celebration of 
		   Arthur Guinness signing his 9,000-year lease – a fitting way to 
		   mark 200 years of groundbreaking brewing. With a skillful pairing 
		   of nitrogen gas and carbon dioxide, the smooth, velvety texture 
		   was born. Distinguished by its legendary stormy surge upon pouring,
		   Guinness Draught brewed up a storm all of its own. It established 
		   itself as the top-selling Guinness beer with lightning speed. 
		   Drinkers were instantly drawn to its complexity; its bold combination
		   of flavors made a lasting impression. Guinness Draught was an 
		   unparalleled success.</p>
