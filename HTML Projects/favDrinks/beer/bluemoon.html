		<h2><b>THE RIGHT BLEND OF INGREDIENTS AND IMAGNATION</b></h2>
		<p>Blue Moon® Belgian White* was our first year-round release 
		   back in 1995.<br />
		   
		   It started with our brewmaster, Keith Villa, 
		   wanting to craft a beer inspired by the flavorful Belgian Wits 
		   he enjoyed while studying brewing in Belgium. He brewed his 
		   interpretation using Valencia orange peel versus the traditional 
		   tart Curaçao orange peel, for a subtle sweetness, and added a 
		   touch of coriander to provide balance. Then he added oats and 
		   wheat to create a smooth, creamy finish that’s inviting to the 
		   palate. As a final touch, he garnished the beer with an orange 
		   slice to heighten the citrus aroma and taste. Its natural unfiltered
		   appearance adds to the depth of flavors in Belgian White*.<br />
		   
		   Available in 12-oz. bottles, 6-pack, 12-pack, 12-oz. can, 16-oz. can,
